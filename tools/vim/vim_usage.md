## copy paste

Cut and paste:

1. Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
2. Press v to select characters, or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks (use  Ctrl-q if Ctrl-v is mapped to paste).
3. Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
4. Press d to cut (or y to copy).
5. Move to where you would like to paste.
6. Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after.
7. Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:

d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut
y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy
