# doctest module usage

Using this module, you can write the testcases in the `docstring`.
The way you write the testcases is to paste the commands and its
output from the python shell.

It has two work modes, one is to integrate the testcode(the output
of python shell) in the docstring of the module/methods.
The other is to write the test code in a separate file.[^1]
