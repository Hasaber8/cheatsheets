## modulization

## my and our keywords

`my` and `our` are prefixes which can be used before
variable definitions[^1].

The following is the comparisons between the 2:

|              my variables                |              our variables         |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| non-package var                          |              package var           |
| private                                  |            non private             |
| global                                   |            non-global              |
| new                                      |           not necessarily new      |
| can't be access outside the modle        | can be accessed outside the module |
